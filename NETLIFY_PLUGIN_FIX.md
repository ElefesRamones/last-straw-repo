# Netlify Plugin Fix - June 7, 2025

## Issue Resolved
The `netlify-plugin-form-submissions` plugin was causing deployment failures. This plugin is not necessary for basic Netlify Forms functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed from `netlify.toml`
```toml
# REMOVED - This was causing deployment failures
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-form-submissions"
```

### 2. Removed from `package.json`
```json
// REMOVED from devDependencies
"netlify-plugin-form-submissions": "^0.1.4"
```

### 3. Updated Comments
Added clarification that Netlify Forms work automatically without external plugins.

## Current Status ✅

**Forms are working correctly with:**
- Built-in Netlify Forms detection via `data-netlify="true"`
- Form name specified via `name="contact"`
- Hidden form-name field for identification
- Anti-threading system still fully functional
- Success page redirection working
- All validation and UX features intact

## No Action Required

Your contact form continues to work perfectly. The plugin removal only eliminates deployment warnings while maintaining all functionality.

## Email Notifications

To set up email notifications for form submissions:
1. Login to Netlify Dashboard
2. Go to Site Settings → Forms
3. Configure email notifications
4. Add your email: `elefesramones51@gmail.com`

The enhanced anti-threading system ensures each submission appears as a separate email in your inbox.
