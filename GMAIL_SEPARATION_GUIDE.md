# Gmail Email Separation Guide

## Problem
Gmail groups emails together when they have similar subjects and come from the same sender, making it hard to track individual portfolio inquiries.

## Solution Implemented

### üéØ **Dynamic Subject Lines**
Each form submission now generates a unique subject line format:
```
Portfolio Inquiry from [Name] [Budget] (Timeline) - [Timestamp]
```

**Examples:**
- `Portfolio Inquiry from John Smith [$1K-2.5K] (1 Week) - 2025-06-07T14-30-22`
- `Portfolio Inquiry from Sarah Wilson [Budget TBD] (Flexible) - 2025-06-07T15-45-10`
- `Portfolio Inquiry from Mike Chen [Under $500] (URGENT) - 2025-06-07T16-22-33`

### üîç **Unique Identifiers**
Each email now includes:
- **Inquiry ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., `INQ-1717765822456-x8k9m2n4p`)
- **Submission Time**: ISO timestamp
- **Client Timezone**: User's timezone
- **Page Source**: Form source identification

### üìß **Gmail Filter Setup (Updated)**

Create a new Gmail filter with these settings:

**Filter Criteria:**
- From: `forms@netlify.com`
- Subject: `Portfolio Inquiry`

**Actions:**
- Apply label: `Portfolio Inquiries`
- Never send to spam
- Mark as important
- **Enable**: "Also apply filter to matching conversations"

### üé® **Enhanced Email Content**
Each email now contains structured data:
- Client contact information
- Project budget range
- Timeline requirements
- Unique inquiry tracking ID
- Submission timestamp with timezone

## Additional Gmail Settings

### Turn Off Conversation View (Optional)
1. Go to Gmail Settings (gear icon)
2. Click "See all settings"
3. Under "General" tab
4. Find "Conversation view"
5. Select "Conversation view off"
6. Save changes

This will show each email as a separate item instead of grouped conversations.

### Enhanced Search & Organization

With the new system, you can now search for specific inquiries:
- `subject:"Portfolio Inquiry" budget` - Find all budget-related inquiries
- `subject:"URGENT"` - Find urgent requests
- `subject:"$5K+"` - Find high-budget projects
- `"INQ-"` - Search by inquiry ID

### Mobile Gmail App
The mobile app respects the same filters and will show separate emails for each inquiry.

## Testing the System

1. Submit test forms with different names/budgets
2. Check Gmail - each should appear as separate emails
3. Verify subject lines are unique
4. Confirm filter is working properly
